## Chapter 13 - Gases

### Key concepts

### 13-1 Model to Explain Gas Behavior

- Air is a mixture of gases 
  -  80% Nitrogen, 16% Oxygen, 3% CO<sub>2</sub>
  -  Medium in which energy and matter are transported
-  Atoms and molecules compose gases
-  The nature of gases
   -  Gases have mass
   -  It is easy to compress gases
   -  Gases fill their containers completely 
   -  Different gases can move through each other rapidly
      -  Diffusion: the movement of one substance through another
   -  The pressure of a gas depends on its temperature 
      -  Higher the temperature, the lower the pressure
   -  Gas properties are explained by a kinetic-moleculer model
