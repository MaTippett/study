## Chapter 13 - Gases

### Key concepts

### 13-1 Model to Explain Gas Behavior

- Air is a mixture of gases 
  -  80% Nitrogen, 16% Oxygen, 3% CO<sub>2</sub>
  -  Medium in which energy and matter are transported
-  Atoms and molecules compose gases

#### The nature of gases
-  Gases have mass
-  It is easy to compress gases
-  Gases fill their containers completely 
-  Different gases can move through each other rapidly
   -  Diffusion: the movement of one substance through another
-  The pressure of a gas depends on its temperature 
   -  Higher the temperature, the lower the pressure
-  Gas properties are explained by a kinetic-moleculer model
  
#### The kinetic-molecular theory
-  Begins with the assumption that a gas consists of small particles that have mass
-  Particles in a gas must be separated from each other by relatively large distances
-  Particles of a gas must be in constant rapid motion
-  Gases exert pressure b/c their particles frequently collide with the walls of the container in which they are held
-  Collisions of gas must be perfectly elastic
   -  Gas particles keep colliding with each other and with container walls w/o slowing down
-  Gas pressure increases when temperature increases 
   -  KE = mv^2/2
      -  Kinetic energy equals mass times velocity squared divided by two
